If you have a LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 kit, you might be interested in building and programming a humanoid robot that can walk, talk, and interact with you. The humanoid program is one of the many projects that you can find on the [LEGO Education website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts/nxt/software), where you can also download the software and instructions for free[^1^] [^2^]. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the humanoid program on your computer and your NXT brick.

## Step 1: Download the Software
 
The first step is to download the LEGO Mindstorms Education NXT software, which is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X. You can find the download link on the [LEGO Education website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts/nxt/software) [^1^] [^3^], under the section "Software". You will need to enter your product key, which is printed on the back of your NXT software CD case. If you don't have the product key, you can contact LEGO Education customer service for assistance.
 
Once you have downloaded the software, run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to accept the terms of use and choose a destination folder for the software. The installation process may take a few minutes, depending on your computer speed.
 
## Step 2: Download the Humanoid Program
 
The next step is to download the humanoid program, which is a file with the extension .rbt. You can find it on the [LEGO Education website](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts/nxt/software) [^1^] [^3^], under the section "Projects". Scroll down to find the project called "Humanoid", and click on the "Download" button. You will need to enter your email address and agree to receive newsletters from LEGO Education. You can unsubscribe at any time.
 
Once you have downloaded the humanoid program, save it in a folder where you can easily find it later. You can also rename it if you want.
 
## Step 3: Install the Humanoid Program
 
The final step is to install the humanoid program on your NXT brick, which is the brain of your robot. To do this, you will need to connect your NXT brick to your computer using a USB cable. Then, open the LEGO Mindstorms Education NXT software that you installed in step 1. You will see a window with four tabs: "Getting Started", "Robot Educator", "Programming", and "Projects". Click on the "Projects" tab, and then click on "Open". Navigate to the folder where you saved the humanoid program in step 2, and select it.
 
You will see a window with a graphical representation of your robot and its sensors and motors. You can also see the code that controls its behavior, which consists of blocks that represent different actions and commands. You can modify the code if you want, but be careful not to change anything that might affect the robot's stability or functionality.
 
To install the humanoid program on your NXT brick, click on "Download" at the bottom of the window. You will see a progress bar that shows how much of the program has been transferred to your NXT brick. When it is done, you will hear a beep from your NXT brick, indicating that it is ready to run.
