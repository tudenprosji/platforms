I wanted to play call of duty black ops 2 on my computer, so I downloaded all the files from a website. After the download was complete, I extracted the files using a software. Then I opened the setup folder to install the game. However, I was shocked to find a virus in the folder. My antivirus program, Kaspersky, detected it and warned me. Kaspersky is one of the most powerful and reliable protection programs available. I don't know how the virus got into the folder or what it could do to my computer.
