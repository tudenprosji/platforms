## Programming Your URC Remote Control with CCP Software
 
To program your URC remote control with CCP software, you need to connect your remote control to your computer using a USB cable. Then, open the CCP software and select your remote model from the list. You will see a graphical interface that shows the layout of your remote control and its buttons.
 
You can customize your remote control by adding devices, macros, pages, buttons, labels and graphics. You can also assign functions and commands to each button using IR codes or IP codes. You can use the built-in database of codes for common devices or learn codes from other remotes using the "sniffing mode" feature.
 
You can also use the "home designer" feature to create a graphical user interface for your remote control that matches your home decor and style. You can choose from different themes, backgrounds, icons and fonts. You can also import your own images and graphics.
 
When you are done programming your remote control, you can save your project file and upload it to your remote control using the "upload" button. You can also test your remote control using the "test" button or simulate it using the "simulate" button.
